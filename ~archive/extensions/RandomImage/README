== Overview ==

The Random Image extension adds a <randomimage> tag to the MediaWiki parser
which allows for randomisation of multimedia content on a page.

When the tag is rendered, a random image is selected from those uploaded and
inserted at the location of the tag. Users can select a custom size, float
and provide a caption for the resulting image; captions can also be pulled
from the image description page.

== Requirements ==

This version of the RandomImage extension requires MediaWiki 1.10.0 or above.

== Installation ==

To install the extension, place all extension files into a `RandomImage`
directory within your MediaWiki `extensions` directory, then edit
`LocalSettings.php` and add the following line

	require_once( "{$IP}/extensions/RandomImage/RandomImage.php" );

Installation can be verified through the Special:Version page on the wiki.

== Use ==

The tag can be used in two forms:

	<randomimage />
		Produces an image using an automatic caption (see below)
	<randomimage></randomimage>
		Produces an image with a preset caption (text inside the tags)
		
The tag also supports the following attributes:

	size
		Set the image width (default is the user's thumbnail width)
	float
		Float the image; valid values are 'left', 'center' and 'right'
	choices
		Confines image selection to a pipe-delimited list of images
		
For example:

	<randomimage size="100" float="left" choices="Apple.jpg|Pear.jpg" />

== Caption ==

If no caption is specified, one will be pulled, if possible, from the
image description page.

If the description page contains text wrapped in <randomcaption>
</randomcaption> tags, then this will be used as the caption. The tags
are ignored during normal page views. Otherwise, the first paragraph of
the page text will be used as the caption.

== Selection ==

On wikis where non-images are uploaded (e.g. sound and video files, or
documents, etc.), the extension might select a non-image file. There are
few performance-efficient means of limiting those files selected.

If $wgRandomImageStrict is switched on, a more complex database query will
be performed, with a greater performance cost, which will ensure only images
with an "image" major MIME type are selected.

By default, this option has the same value as $wgMiserMode. You may wish to
switch it off if all of the content on your wiki has an appropriate renderer.

== Caching ==

By default, the output is cached in the regular parser cache. This can be
advantageous on larger sites which need to use caching to reduce the effects
of load, however, it means that content is not 100% dynamic.

To disable the parser cache on pages which use the <randomimage> tag, set
$wgRandomImageNoCache = true; in LocalSettings.php (after the call to include
the extension file). This will affect all users, and might incur additional
overhead on pageviews.
