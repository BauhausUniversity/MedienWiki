[[Maps 0.7.5]]

In order to use this version of Maps, you need to have Validator 0.3.6 installed. If you get a distribution
from this page, you don't need to bother this, since Validator comes bundled with every release, and will
automatically be loaded by Maps. If you get Maps from SVN trunk, or a tag, you must make sure you also get
Validator.

Once you have downloaded the code, place the 'Maps' directory within your MediaWiki 'extensions' directory.
Then add the following code to your LocalSettings.php file:

# Maps
require_once( "$IP/extensions/Maps/Maps.php" );

For using Google Maps or Yahoo! Maps, you must enter their API keys in the settings file. If you don't already
have them, you can obtain them at the Google Maps API page and Yahoo Maps API page. Note that the Google Maps
API key is required for both displaying maps AND for geocoding (and therefore also required when you use
display_address with a Yahoo! Map). Also note that use of the Google Maps API is free only if your site is
accessible to the public; otherwise it costs money - read the Google Maps terms of service [0] for further details.

Once you have successfully installed Maps, please add your wiki to the Sites that use Maps section [1].
