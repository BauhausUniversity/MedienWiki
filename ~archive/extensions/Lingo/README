Lingo is a glossary extension to MediaWiki, that lets you define abbreviations
and their definitions on a wiki page. It displays these definitions whenever an
abbreviation is hovered over in an article.

The extension is still in early stages, so please report bugs.

See http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Lingo for online documentation.


== Installation ==

This extension was developed for MediaWiki 1.16 und upwards. Other version might
work, but are not tested.

1. Download the package. Unpack the folder inside /extensions (so that the files
   are in /extensions/Lingo, rename the folder if necessary).

2. In your LocalSettings.php, add the following line to the end of the file:

   require_once("$IP/extensions/Lingo/Lingo.php");

3. Create the page "Terminology" (no namespace), and insert some entries using
   the following syntax:


;FTP:File Transport Protocol
;AAAAA:American Association Against Acronym Abuse
;ACK:Acknowledge
;AFAIK:As Far As I Know
;AWGTHTGTATA:Are We Going To Have To Go Through All This Again
;HTTP:HyperText Transfer Protocol


== Customization ==

The following settings may be used:

* $wgexLingoPage to specify the name of the terminology page
  Example: $wgexLingoPage = 'Glossary';

* $wgexLingoDisplayOnce to specify that each term should be annotated only once
  per page
  Example: $wgexLingoDisplayOnce = true;

* $wgexLingoUseNamespaces to specify what namespaces should or should not be used
  Example: $wgexLingoUseNamespaces[NS_TALK] = false;

If you want to use these settings, just include them in LocalSettings.php AFTER
the require_once("$IP/extensions/Lingo/Lingo.php");


== Usage ==

By default Lingo will mark up any page that is not in a forbidden namespace. To
exclude a page from markup you can include __NOGLOSSARY__ anywhere in the
article. In some cases it may be necessary to exclude portions of a page, e.g.
because Lingo interferes with some JavaScript. This can be achieved by wrapping
the part in an HTML element (e.g. a span or a div) and specify class="noglossary".


== Credits ==

Lingo is a rewrite of Extension:Terminology, written by BarkerJr with
modifications by Benjamin Kahn. It was originally written by Barry Coughlan and
is currently maintained by Stephan Gambke.
