#Wireframes

Here are possible arrangements for a future page layouts.If they have the .ep extension they can be opened and edited using the open source tool pencil for Win/lin/OsX (http://pencil.evolus.vn/)

Please keep in mind:
They are NOT about visual design (smooth looking buttons, gradients, color choice and the like)
