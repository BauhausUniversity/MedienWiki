We want to provide teaching material that guides people in using the wiki and eases getting started. 

Requirements: 
* Be motivating: I't eases everybodys life if the students teach themselves so we'd like to keep them learning
* Use Simple language: It's easier to understand, less hard to read.
* Be careful about edgecases: Everything included might draw attention away fom the other content. So better keep stuff out than in.
* Put yourself in their shoes: New student's experience with collaborative web use is often not more than sharing quotes on Facebook. Maybe thats bad but we need to make the best out of it, so mind them when writing.
