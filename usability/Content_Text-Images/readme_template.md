Having article templates saves work; having copy-past-templates eases creation of articles. 

## Knowledge form usability tests:
### Module Pages
People use the mediawiki as a replacements/supplement in combination with the vorlesungsverzeichnis, so we should
* make both play well together and provide a link back to the VLV
* Have some suggested Standard Structure for a Module

### User Pages 
* People tate interste in their fellow students and their work so we could make creating a presentation of works easier or at least suggest doing so
* I addition user pages could be edited as a kind of tutorial: "to get started, create your user page and embed images and links to other pages you like, like classes you take etc."
