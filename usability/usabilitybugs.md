# Bugs
##Signup
* Signup is only accessible if you click on login first. "Log in â€“ Don't have an account? Create an account"... silly. 

##Homepage Link
The Homepage link-logo (top-left) directs to the uni Page, but students expect it to direct to the start page of the wiki

## Login/Logout/login
Logging out and logging in again (oops, I did not want to logout!) leads to a "logout" page which is in addition deleted. I find the lack of logic disturbing. 

#Possible improvements
* Search more prominent

##Just uploaded
Have a link in the imagepage that AJAX-Requests the last uploaded image by the same user
using https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Recentchanges, scrap the name of the user from somewhere; paste it in the query and limit the query only to files. Display the filenames in overlay.
