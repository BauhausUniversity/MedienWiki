# Bugs
##Signup
* Signup is only accessible if you click on login first. "Log in – Don't have an account? Create an account"... silly. 

##Homepage Link
The Homepage link-logo (top-left) directs to the uni Page, but students expect it to direct to the start page of the wiki

## Login/Logout/login
* Logging out and logging in again (oops, I did not want to logout!) leads to a "logout" page which is in addition deleted. I find the lack of logic disturbing. 

* Login is at the moment placed just below "contributions" and a mispositioning of the mouse easily leads to a logout. 

#Possible improvements
* Search more prominent
