##About##
This is a test folder for the new **MedienWiki** skin. The current Skin, which will be customized, is based on the current Version of the Skin Vector. Vector is MediaWiki's current default skin. It was built by the UsabilityInitiative project to replace MonoBook.Vector was the first skin to separate the flat level content_actions into the categorized content_navigation. Some of Vector's special features are currently separated into Extension:Vector http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Vector.
